# django_project_structure
Locally you need to make sure the script can run so you must set permissions 

`chmod u+x create-api-project-structure.sh`

Then as usual to execute the script you run:
 `./create-api-project-structure.sh`
 
 This should be executed in the same path where your manage.py file is. Essentially we're creating a django app called 'api'.
